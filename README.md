Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Name: Katherine Pak
Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

I am a software developer trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python (Django), and C# (.NET, MVC, ASP). I've written and contributed to live web applications using Python/Django and C#/ASP.NET.

Though I am excited to start a career in the tech industry, I hope to bring the expertise and skill set I've earned in my previous experiences.
